# OpenCV Video Face Recognition Project  
  
## Project Task:  
#### Make an end-to-end Face Recognition service  
  
## The project will contain:  
1. A web page, where a user activates his webcam  
2. Backend part, which will send user's webcam stream to API Service and then receives the stream back, but with recognized faces on it (expecting to make it in realtime)  
3. API service, which will receive video stream and recognize faces, contained in a database  
4. Most likely a NoSQL Database for containing logs and dataset of faces  
  
## I'm expecting to use such technologies in this project:  
Python, OpenCV,  
Uvicorn Server + FastAPI or Flask,  
MongoDB or SQLite,  
tiny bit of html/css
